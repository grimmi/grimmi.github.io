    <h3>Using VS 2015 to develop ArcObjects with .NET</h3>
    <h4>2018-01-19</h4>
    <p>
        Because I wanted to try to make something useful for ArcCatalog, I decided to spend the ~100â‚¬ after a long search on esri's
        convoluted web presence. (For reference:
        <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgis-for-personal-use">this is where you should look for that</a>. As long as you're just playing around, you don't need one of those expensive
        developer subscriptions.)
    </p>
    <p>
        First problem: ArcObjects 10.5 does not support VS 2017, you need to have VS 2015 (doesn't matter which version - all are
        fine) installed to get to use the project templates. Okay, done (I had never uninstalled VS 2015 anyway).
    </p>
    <p>
        Next up: Trying to build the template resulted in the following error message:
    </p>

    <div class="error">
        "The ValidateAddInXMLTask task failed unexpectedly. System.IO.FileNotFoundException:
        Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.12.0, Version=12.0.0.0,
        Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' or one of its dependencies.
        The system cannot find the file specified."
    </div>
    <p>
        Great. Why would it work right out of the box, right? Thankfully, esri has you covered:
        <a href="https://support.esri.com/en/technical-article/000012659">in their knowledge base they describe a workaround</a>. Turns out, you don't just need VS 2015, you need VS 2013
        as well (of course, what else?!). Well, not the whole VS 2013, they only really need the shell which you can download
        from Microsoft separately. But don't try the link esri provides - that leads to a "sorry, this page no longer exists"
        page at microsoft. Thanks to
        <em>John Grabanski's comment</em> on
        <a href="https://gis.stackexchange.com/a/182984/23448">this gis.stackexchange.com answer</a> I found
        <a href="https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads?q=visual%20studio%202013&amp;wt.mc_id=o~msft~vscom~older-downloads">a working link.</a> I wrote this post while the shell was installing, which leads me to the next point in this bizarre
        odyssey: You cannot install the file you just downloaded from Microsoft! You get some blurb about compatibility mode
        being on when you try to execute the setup. The solution? Rename the file... no, seriously. If you read the comment
        I linked to above, you'll see that you have to rename the file for the setup to work. I don't even...
    </p>
    <p>
        Alright, setup's done. I can't build in VS 2017 yet, but I'll look at that some other day. VS 2015 seems to work, though.
        After just a few simple steps:
        <ul>
            <li>install VS 2015 (any version)</li>
            <li>download the VS 2013 shell from Microsoft:
                <a href="https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads?q=visual%20studio%202013&amp;wt.mc_id=o~msft~vscom~older-downloads">download</a>
            </li>
            <li>rename the downloaded file to vssdk_full.exe and run it</li>
        </ul>
        Easy, right?
    </p>
