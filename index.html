  <h1>Missing MSHTML and msbuild</h1>

<h3>2018-01-30</h3>

<p>Just today I was faced with a curious case of builds failing on our build server. We run our commits through a <a href="https://jenkins.io">Jenkins</a> server, where we use <a href="https://cakebuild.net">Cake</a> to build our solutions. Which works fine most of the time. As I was coming into the office today, I saw all builds on a particular Jenkins node failing. (We have several nodes because we have to build our projects against specific versions of other software and don't want to handle that on one machine.)

<h1>Querying for z values in ArcObjects</h1>

<h3>2018-01-27</h3>

<p>This week at work we were looking for a way to filter on z-values of features. Suprisingly, this is not straightforward to do with ArcObjects. Querying x/y is simple: you just take a <code>SpatialFilter</code> and put your <code>IGeometry</code> into that, run that filter against your featureclass and you're done.

<h1>Logparser and the registry</h1>

<h3>2018-01-22</h3>

<p>Recently at work I had the problem of having to clean the registry of hundreds (maybe thousands) of orphaned entries. Our software has to registry a load of COM libraries because of how we integrate with our parent application. Normally this isn't a big problem, you call <code>regasm /unregister</code> and everything's fine.

<h1>Using VS 2015 to develop ArcObjects with .NET</h1>

<h3>2018-01-19</h3>

<p>Because I wanted to try to make something useful for ArcCatalog, I decided to spend the ~100â‚¬ after a long search on esri's convoluted web presence. (For reference: <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgis-for-personal-use">this is where you should look for that</a>. As long as you're just playing around, you don't need one of those expensive developer subscriptions.)
